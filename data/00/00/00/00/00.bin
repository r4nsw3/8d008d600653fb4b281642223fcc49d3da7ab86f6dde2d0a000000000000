  |   Overcooked 2 is serving up more chefs, more kitchens, more recipes,   |
  |   more co-op madness and even more Kevin with the second helping of     |
  |   concentrated co-op chaos!                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Buddy up or go it alone as you cook up a storm, chopping, steaming    |
  |   and frying your way through dynamic and outright crazy levels.        |
  |   Now with online multiplayer for up to four chefs, there is no such    |
  |   thing as too many cooks and the steaks have never been higher as      |
  |   you prepare to save the Onion Kingdom... Again.                       |
  |                                                                         |

  |   * Gather round the campfire for S'More Overcooked 2                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * It's time for some camping capers as you take a trek through the    |
  |     forests of the Onion Kingdom. Joining Kevin and the Onion King      |
  |     are 4 new chefs that are right at home in the woodland kitchens;    |
  |     Scout Chef, Bear Chef, Beaver Chef and the bespectacled Owl Chef    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * You'll need to chop wood to keep the fires burning as you fry up    |
  |     a hearty breakfast, or toast tasty S'mores across 15 new levels     |
  |     set amongst tree-tops and campsites. Fresh levels of co-operation   |
  |     will be needed for the new wearable backpacks that hold the         |
  |     ingredients the team of chefs need to serve the hungry campers      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * For your convenience, we decided to include again both previous     |
  |     DLCs (Too Many Cooks Pack and Surf 'n' Turf) since they were        |
  |     small, so you don't have to hunt them down again                    |
  |                                                                         |
